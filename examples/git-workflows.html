--
## What is `origin`?
--
## `fetch` vs `pull`
--
# Working with branches
--
## `checkout` vs `reset`
--
## `merge` vs `rebase`
--
## `merge` vs `merge --squash`
--
## How do I deal with conflicts?
	git fetch
	git merge origin/master
	git status
	vim blah
	git add blah
	git commit -m "Merge master"
	git checkout master
	git merge MyBranch --squash`

# Practices
--
## What is a reasonable commit? 
1. Standalone
2. Testable
2. Explainable
3. Not too big
--
## How often should commit? 
Private commits vs public commits
--
## Good commit messages
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

	Make Source.indexOf(ByteString) significantly faster
	
	Previously the algorithm that did this was extremely inefficient, and 
	had worst case runtime of O(N * S * S) for N is size of the bytestring 
	and S is the number of segments.

	The new code runs in O(N * S). It accomplishes this by not starting 
	each search at the first segment, which could occur many times when 
	called by RealBufferedSource.
